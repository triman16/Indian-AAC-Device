Bolo (बोलो) - An AAC App for Indian Children
Description
Learning the English alphabet can be a challenge, but it doesn't have to be. Bolo (बोलो) is a first-of-its-kind interactive learning app designed specifically for Indian children. We bridge the gap between two languages by providing a visual, interactive platform for communication. This app is designed to be a simple, accessible AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication) device, helping children with limited verbal abilities express their needs and desires.

Features
Core Vocabulary: A set of pre-defined cards with essential daily-use words in both English and Hindi, paired with relatable images.

Dynamic Sentence Building: Children can tap on the cards to create a visual sentence in the top display area.

Custom Word Addition: Caregivers can easily add new vocabulary. Simply type an English word, and the app uses a language model to translate it into Hindi and create a new card in the main grid.

Text-to-Speech: Press the "बोलो" (Speak) button to have the entire constructed sentence read aloud in a clear Hindi voice.

Minimalist & Kid-Friendly Interface: The simple, clean design and large, clear icons make the app intuitive and easy for children to use.
